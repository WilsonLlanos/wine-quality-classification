**üç∑ Wine Classification with Machine Learning**

- This project aims to classify red wines based on their physicochemical properties using machine learning algorithms. The entire development was carried out on the Databricks platform, covering the full ML pipeline: from data cleaning to model deployment and tracking with MLflow.

üîç **Objective**
- Predict wine quality (classified into 3 categories: low, medium, or high) based on chemical attributes using supervised machine learning.

‚öôÔ∏è **Technologies and Libraries**
- Databricks (Apache Spark environment)

- Python

- Pandas / PySpark

- Scikit-learn

- Seaborn / Matplotlib / Sweetviz

- MLflow (for tracking and model registration)

- SMOTE (for data balancing)

- Random Forest Classifier

üß™ **Development Pipeline**
1 - Exploratory data analysis (visualizations and Sweetviz profiling)

2 - Outlier and missing value treatment

3 - Reclassification of the target variable (quality) into 3 categories

4 - Data balancing using SMOTE

5 - Feature scaling using StandardScaler

6 - Training models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest

7 - Hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV

8 - Model evaluation using metrics such as Accuracy and ROC AUC

9 - Model registration and signature tracking using MLflow

10 - Prediction testing with new samples

üìä **Results**

1 - Final accuracy with Random Forest: 90.9%

2 - ROC AUC score: 91.3%

3 - Model registered and versioned with MLflow

4 - Model able to generalize well for new input samples

üß† **Key Learnings**
Although the first model tested was Logistic Regression, it did not perform well with the multi-class problem. Instead of overfitting this simpler model, I switched to Random Forest, which significantly improved the results. This decision emphasized the importance of experimenting with different models and validating them with proper metrics.
